- The following changes have been made:
  o Added Chess324 (x16) starting position classification. This
    extends the DFRC classification scheme by appending the castling
    rights. For example, "DFRC 502:508 KQq" for white kingside and
    queenside castling rights, and black queenside-only castling
    rights. (Issue #31)
  o Internal scripting change to use 'id' in gamelist.json instead of
    'dno' as the event key. It turns out that 'dno' may not always be
    unique. (Issue #30)

    chronological order when ordered alphabetically. For cup events
    and certain test events, the number is suffixed with a
    letter. (Issue #11)
  o The release packages have been reworked. This release contains the
    following packages: (Issue #9)
