Season 22 interim (2022-04-24)
- This release contains all TCEC games up to and including the
  Season 22 Superfinal
- The following chages have been made:
  o FRC 2/3/4 events have been fixed for consistency (Issue #17)
  o A missing '[' was added in the event tag in
    TCEC_Season_16_-_Testing_13_Lczero_1pct_Vs_Qualification.pgn
    Round 2.4. (Issue #19)

Season 21 final (2022-01-09)
- This release contains all games of Season 21 and previous.
- The following major change have been made:
  o The event PGN tags have been reformatted to be more friendly with
    chess database software. The new format adds a running event
    number after the season, which makes the events appear in
    chronological order when ordered alphabetically. For cup events
    and certain test events, the number is suffixed with a
    letter. (Issue #11)
  o The release packages have been reworked. This release contains the
    following packages: (Issue #9)
    - TCEC-everything-compact.zip (TCEC-everything-compet-no-frc.pgn,
      TCEC-everything-compet-frc.pgn, TCEC-everything-bonus-test.pgn)
    - TCEC-all-in-one-compact.zip (TCEC-everything.pgn)
    - TCEC-events-full.7z (all individual events with full annotations)
- The following content changes have been made:
  o Season 6 FRC event is added. This event is now called FRC 0, as it
    predates the TCEC S16 FRC 1 event. (Issue #10)
  o Cup 4 bronze match games have been fixed. In previous releases,
    this round incorrectly contained Cup 5 bronze match games,
    instead. (Issue #12)
